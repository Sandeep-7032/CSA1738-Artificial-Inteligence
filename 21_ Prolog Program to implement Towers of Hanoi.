% Define predicate to solve Towers of Hanoi
hanoi(N) :-
    move(N, left, center, right).

% Base case: Moving 0 discs requires no moves
move(0, _, _, _) :- !.

% Recursive case: Move N discs from A to C using B as auxiliary
move(N, A, B, C) :-
    N > 0,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, A, C, B),     % Move N-1 discs from A to B using C
    move_disk(A, C),      % Move the Nth disc from A to C
    move(M, B, A, C).     % Move N-1 discs from B to C using A

% Helper predicate to print the move
move_disk(From, To) :-
    format('Move disk from ~w to ~w~n', [From, To]).
